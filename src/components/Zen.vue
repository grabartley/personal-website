        During my internship with <a href="https://coderdojo.com/foundation/" target="_blank">the CoderDojo Foundation</a> I developed new features and pages for <a href="http://zen.coderdojo.com" target="_blank">Zen</a>.
        I mainly worked on the <a href="http://www.github.com/CoderDojo/cp-zen-frontend" target="_blank">new front-end</a> which was partly redesigned and rewritten using the
        <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">VueJS framework</a> while I was there but I also worked on the <a href="https://github.com/CoderDojo/cp-zen-platform" target="_blank">older front-end</a>
        using <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">Angular 1</a> and the back-end microservices using <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">NodeJS</a> and <a href="http://senecajs.org/" target="_blank">SenecaJS</a>.
        I documented my experience in more detail in <a href="https://coderdojo.com/news/2017/10/25/what-ive-learned-and-am-still-learning-at-the-coderdojo-foundation/" target="_blank">this blog post</a>.
        Zen is an <strong>open source</strong> platform so all of it's source code can be found on <a href="http://www.github.com/CoderDojo" target="_blank">CoderDojo's GitHub</a>.<br><br>

        The work I did during my internship led to me wanting to <strong>continue contributing</strong> to the development of Zen which I was able to do through <a href="https://github.com/grabartley/coderdojo-zen-projects" target="_blank">my final year project</a> in my final year of study at DCU.
        This individual project focused on the <strong>design, testing and implementation</strong> of a coding project creation, management and interaction solution for Zen which allows CoderDojo Ninjas to upload, share and interact with coding projects directly through Zen without ever leaving their browser.
        This was a <strong>very challenging</strong> and <strong>very rewarding</strong> project to work on and I am delighted to have been able to complete it.
